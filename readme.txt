Steps to recreate the results:

Step 1: Download the training, validation and testing data along with the experiment parameters csv file. The data can be found in this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18VKDa4cB8gW8pMypARc6pyBWGFFUIPKw?usp=sharing (Note: you can use gdoqn to download the datasets)
Step 2: Run the similarity_based_label_smoothing_training_inference_notebook.ipynb notebook, which contains the training, validation and inference code. 

Notes:
1. The model and utilities to load the models can be found in Models.py and utils.py respectively.
2. The trained models from all the experiments along with the results can be found in the models and results folders respectively, in the previously shared link.
